# Dataproject

In our project we are investigating whether the Phillips Curve and the associated negative relationship between inflation and unemployment is applicable to the world nowadays. We are collecting yearly rates of inflation and unemployment from the World Bank from 1991 to 2017. By grouping selected countries into different categories - countries inside EU versus countries outside EU - and by separating the data into different time samples - pre financial crisis, post financial crisis etc. - we will analyze this well-known model. 

Our project includes a descriptive analysis to present inflation and unemployment rates based on the different groups and sub-samples. Afterwards we will present this data by graphs to visually analyse the proposed negative relationship between these two rates.
