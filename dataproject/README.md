# Data project - 1312

In our project we are investigating whether the Phillips Curve and the associated negative relationship between inflation and unemployment is applicable to the world nowadays. We are collecting yearly rates of inflation and unemployment from the World Bank from 1991 to 2017 for selected countries. We're constructing two groups of countries: one group with selected countries from the European Union and another group of selected developed countries outside the European Union.

As the European Central Bank in 2015 imposed quantitative easing, we will analyse the effect of this monetary policy on the group of countries inside the European Union by comparing them to the group of countries outside the European Union - both for the full period from our sample (1991 to 2017) and for the period efter the implementation of the programme (2015 to 2017).

Our project includes a part with descriptive analysis and some associated plots to illustrate the most important statistical figures for our data and the development over time for inflation and unemployment rates. Afterwards we will perform a panel data regression analysis to investigate whether there has been a negative relationship between inflation and unemployment after the quantitative easing programme started in 2015.
