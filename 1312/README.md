This portfolio includes group 1312's final versions of their data analysis project, model analysis project and the exam project. 
The data analysis project contains an analysis of the Phillips curve, where it is investigated how the Phillips curve looks in two groups of countries - eurozone countries and similar non-eurozone countries. Furthermore, the Phillips curves are related to the ECB's quantitative easing program to see if this has had any visible effects on the relationship between unemployment and inflation. 
The model analysis project contains an analysis of a model that explores externalities. Here different equilibria are derived and the social optimum is related to the market equilibrium. We infer a Pigouvian tax and solve the model numerically to give further perspective on the model. 
Finally, the exam project contains our answers to the three exam tasks that explores models for human capital accumulation, the AS-AD model and an exchange economy.
