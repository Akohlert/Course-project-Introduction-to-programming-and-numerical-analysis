In our project we are investigating whether the Phillips Curve and the associated negative relationship between inflation and unemployment is applicable to the world nowadays. We are collecting yearly rates of inflation and unemployment from the World Bank from 1991 to 2017 for selected countries. We're constructing two groups of countries: one group with selected countries from the eurozone and another group of selected developed countries not part of the eurozone.

As the European Central Bank in 2015 imposed quantitative easing, we will analyse the effect of this monetary policy on the group of countries inside the eurozone by comparing them to the group of countries outside the eurozone - both for the full period from our sample (1991 to 2017) and for the period efter the implementation of the programme (2015 to 2017).

Our project includes a part with descriptive analysis and some associated plots to illustrate the most important statistical figures for our data and the development over time for inflation and unemployment rates. Afterwards we will perform a panel data regression analysis to investigate whether we find any further support for a negative relationship between inflation and unemployment.

To run the regressions please run the following code in your terminal: #pip install linearmodels.
