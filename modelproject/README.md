# Model project - 1312

Our model project consists of a microeconomic model describing the inefficiencies of pollution from production from a social economic point of view. We introduce a demand and a supply function, but the production of the suppliers is associated with a negative externality cost.

We apply model analysis methods to find the market and social equlibria output and prices, where we include graphs to illustrate these equlibria. As a method to solve this social inefficiency from the market powers, we introduce a Pigou tax and calculate the optimal size of this.
